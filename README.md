# Jincy's AI for Social Good: Empowering Healthcare Through Open AI

## Project Overview

Inspired by my family's health challenges, I'm building a web-based AI tool to democratize healthcare insights. This app will help users (patients, students, clinicians) explore data, predict risks, and collaborate—starting simple, scaling to impact.

## Current Phase: Data Exploration (Nov 2025)

Analyzing public health datasets (e.g., anonymized patient records).
Prototyping a user-friendly dashboard for non-experts.
Goal: MVP ready by Q1 2026.

## Future Phases

### Open-Source Release: Share on GitHub for mentorship. Train students in AI/ML via hands-on Git workflows.
### Research Collaboration: Partner with high school teams and clinicians for real-world testing and papers.
### Long-Term Vision: Fuel my Doctorate in AI-driven healthcare.
